MARKETING REVEALED - Challenging the Myths By Willem Burgers

# Marketing: What It Is

-  When you understand, you see no differences.
- You must know the four Cs to use the four Ps.
    - The four Ps marketing mix (McCarthy & Perreault, 1984). A producer-centric view.
        - Product, 
        - Place, 
        - Price,
        - Promotion.
    - The four Cs marketing mix (Lauterborn, B 1990). A consumer-centric view.
        - Consumer wants and needs instead of Product
        - Convenience instead of Place
        - Cost instead of Price
        - Communication instead of Promotion
- It is all the same P and C.
- You don’t need problems for solutions.
- You can learn from the successes of any company in any industry.
-  Marketing tools (Ps) translate into customer experiences (Cs).
- One way or another, making your customer’s life easier saves you money.
- A problem and its solution need not exist in the same **P** dimension.
- You don’t need problems before you look for solutions.

# Marketing R&D

- Is your marketing manager killing you?
- Your R&D budget and allocation need fi xing.
- Love your pink computer guy!
- Embrace continuous experimentation.
- Identify the world’s most successful companies; study their marketing; modify to suit you.
- Marketing can have simple solutions for big problems. But you have to want to look.
- What happens with your product once it has left your building? Do R&D.
- Have at least a few real marketing people in your company.
- Look for questions to ask.
- Don’t let marketing R&D be a career killer.
- Copy this chapter and spread it through your company.
- The willingness to see, try, and embrace solutions is scarce.
