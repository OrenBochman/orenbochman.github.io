# Question:

** Can you recommend a strategy for audience acquisition using my budget **

One key strategy when you stats is to create a positive feedback loop. A method for doing this is to use the so called "self liquidating offer". The idea is to create an offer that is very attractive and has a broad appeal to a large segment of your audience. One point point that is hard to grasp is that you want to push down the price of the offer to the break even point to make it as attractive as possible without taking a loss and yes you want it to also finance your advertising costs.

The key ideas behind this strategy is that 
1. it allows you to grow your audiences for remarketing. And in this case remarketing should cost far less than the original acquisition. 
1. Your main profit making activities will be in scondery action: up-sale, down-sale and cross sale to your audience.
