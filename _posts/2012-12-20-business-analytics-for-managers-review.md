Professor Wolfgang Jank's text [Business Analytics for Managers](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461404057) is part of the Use R! Series published in 2011 by Springer. ISBN 978-1-4614-0406-4

Business Analytics for Managers stand out as gentle introduction for using R for exploratory data analytics and data modeling at an introductory level. While R and statistics are skill not easily acquired working with this book makes for an easy learning curve by focusing on the business side of the work while omitting much of the platform specific implementation details. This would make more sense if the manager will want to ask someone else, say a business analyst, to work with R to get him the results.

The book does not teach the R programming language. **Software for data analysis: programming with R** by *John M. Chambers * is the reference for that but many R books cover the basics, so I don't see this as an issue. I noticed some criticism that this text does not provide code. I guess students would expect Jupyter Notebooks with code in R and Python. It has certainly become easier to do EDA as time goes by, but this is not as widespread as it should be and there is plenty of material online on how to create elegant graphics with R. Reproducing the code samples is not particularly challenging, as the book does not make use of customized code.

Business Analytics for Managers explains how to work with different type of data and how a manager would analyze the different data-sets. It explains the benefits of using a large cross-section of R's visualization techniques for assessing unfamiliar data for global or cross-sectional patterns.

It then goes on to explain the essentials of data handling techniques such as creation of dummy variable interaction variables, variable transformation as well as both linear and non-linear regression models. The reader will quickly grasp what the output of R's regression models mean, how to compare different model's quality and if significant data is also of practical for business application.

Professor Wolfgang Jank kindly furnished me with the data-sets he uses in the book. In this and the following posts I'll be adding my notes and R code I used to follow along the text and reproduce the results and their graphical visualization.
