# TLDR: Neural Network engineering

For the impatient future self - We will start with  NLP engineering insights from this week.

## What is dot-product attention ?

- Attention is a general solution for the sequence alignment problem.
- Attention does not reorder the input sequence.
- It provides a linear transformation which filters the relevant parts of the source for predicting the each item in the target.
- $$ attention(h_t,\bar{h}_s)= softmax(h_t^T\bar{h}_s)$$

  

## What is dot-product attention ?

- Dot Product attention is the most common form of attention.
- In the engineering sense it is suited for a encoder-decoder architecture 
- It is the best fit for tasks where the source source sequence is fully available at the start and the tasks is mapping or transformation the source sequence to an output sequence like 
- It is used for alignment and machine translation or translation.
- $$ attention_{(\cdot)}(Q,V,K) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{n}})V$$  

```python
def DotProductAttention(query,key,value,mask,scale=True):                  
    """Dot product self-attention.
    Args:
        scale (bool): if to scale 
    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: attention array (L_q by L_k)
    """
    # Save query embedding dimension
    depth = query.shape[-1] if scale else 1
    # Calculate scaled query key dot product 
    dots = np.matmul(query, np.swapaxes(key, -1, -2)) / np.sqrt(depth) 
    # Apply the mask
    if mask is not None:
        dots = np.where(mask, dots, np.full_like(dots, -1e9)) 
    logsumexp = scipy.special.logsumexp(dots, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    dots = np.exp(dots - logsumexp)
    attention = np.matmul(dots, value)
    return attention
```

## What is Causal Attention ?

- Causal attention is also called self attention.
- It used to generate a sequence based on previous tokens.
- A mask is used to enforce ignoring of future values in training.
- $$ attention_{self}(Q,V,K) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{n}}+M)V$$  
where n is the embedding dimension the

```python
def SelfAttention(query,key,value,scale=True):                  
    """Self attention.
    Args:
        scale (bool): if to scale 
    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: Self-attention array (L_q by L_k)
    """
    # Save query embedding dimension
    depth = query.shape[-1] if scale else 1
    # Calculate scaled query key dot product 
    dots = np.matmul(query, np.swapaxes(key, -1, -2)) / np.sqrt(depth) 
    logsumexp = scipy.special.logsumexp(dots, axis=-1, keepdims=True)
    dots = np.exp(dots - logsumexp)
    attention = np.matmul(dots, value)
    return attention
```

# What is multi-headed attention?

- multi-headed attention replicates the attention mechanism analogously to the multiple filters used in convolutional layers.
- $$ attention_{mh}(Q,V,K) = softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{n}})V$$


# Additional coding notes:

Here are some notable code snippets. 

## How to use Numpy to reshape a test tensor so it has a (size 0) batch dimension at the front?

This is needed when inspecting single test inputs instead of working with a batch. The model is expecting to process batches of inputs like it saw during training - we therefore need to add a dimension at the start.

~~~python
padded_with_batch = fastnp.expand_dims(fastnp.array(padded),axis=0)
~~~

~~~python
# get log probabilities from the last token output
log_probs = output[0,-1,:] 
~~~

# Video 1: Transformers vs RNNs

RNNs were a big breakthrough and became the state of the art (SOTA) for machine translation (MT).

This illusrates a typical RNN that is used to translate the English sentence "How are you?" to its German equivalent, "Wie sind Sie?".


![rnn-non-parallel](/assets/week2/c4w2-04-rnn-non-parallel.png#hi)

<hr>


![lstm](/assets/week2/c4w2-10-lstm.png#sl)

The LSTM which goes a long way to solving the vanishing gradient problems requires three times the memory and cpu steps a the vanilla RNN.

However, as time went by and models got longer and deeper the biggest challenge with improving RNNs, became  their use of sequential computation. 
<hr>

![seq2seq-steps](/assets/week2/c4w2-11-seq2seq-steps.png#sl)

Which entailed that to process the word "you", the RNN it has to first go through "are" and then "you". 

Two other issues with RNNs are the:

## Information loss 

It becomes harder to keep track of whether the subject is singular or plural as you move further away from the subject.
<hr>

![Transformer](/assets/week2/c4w2-12-transformer.png#hl)

transformer architecture:

in the encoder side 
- lookup layer - 
  the source sequence is converted from one hot encoding to a distributed representation using an embedding.
- this is converted to K V matrices

in the decoder side

<hr>

## Vanishing Gradient

When gradients you back-propagate, the gradients can become really small and as a result.
With small gradient the model will learn very little.


![positional-encoding](/assets/week2/c4w2-14-positonal-encoding.png#sl)

Transformers which are based on attention and don't require any sequential computation per layer, only a single step is needed. 
<hr>

![summary](/assets/week2/c4w2-13-summary.png#sl)

Additionally, the gradient steps that need to be taken from the last output to the first input in a transformer is just one. 

For RNNs, the number of steps increases with longer sequences. Finally, transformers don't suffer from vanishing gradients problems that are related to the length of the sequences. 
<hr>

# Video 2: Transformer Applications

![application](/assets/week2/c4w2-15-application.png#sl)
Transformers have essentially replaced RNN,LSTM and GRUs in sequence processing.

### SOTA Transformers

Transformers Time Line:
   -  GPT-2: 
   -  ElmO
   -  BERT 
   -  T5  
<hr>

## T5 - Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer

![t5](/assets/week2/c4w2-18-t5.gif#hl)

<hr>

![t5](/assets/week2/c4w2-18-t5.png#sl)

T5 can do a number of tasks with a single model. 

While the earlier transformer models were able to score high in many different tasks without specific training. T5 is setup to handle different inputs and respond with output that is relevant to the requested task.

## Classification tasks using T5 
are selected using the initial string:
- Translate English into German
- Cola sentence
- Question
<hr>

![text-to-text-transformer](/assets/week2/c4w2-19-text-to-text-transformer.png#sl)

## Regression tasks using T5:

- Stbs Sentence1 ... Stbs Sentence2 ...

![transformers quiz](/assets/week2/c4w2-21-quiz.png#sl)

I found this one a little confusing. 

We are told that the transformers can do in one operation what RNN needed to do in many steps. Also when querying transformers it does one task at a time. It seem that this question is about the ability of multiple heads to do several tasks at once could not do this is not well understood.

# Video 3: Dot-Product Attention

In the master class linked bellow Dr. ≈Åukasz Kaiser talks about attention and here he is talking about solving the problem of retrieving information from a long sequence. This is essentially what alignment was also trying to do. So if we think about retrieving information from a memory:

- The **Query** is the embedding for a token in the *target* sequence we wish to process. 
- The **Key** is our the embedding of the token from the source sequence.
- The **Value** will become a factor which corresponds to the likelihood of the key being significant for decoding the input.

<hr>

![outline-of-dot-product-attention](/assets/week2/c4w2-22-outline-of-dot-product-attention.png#sl)

Dot product attention was introduced in 2015 by *Minh-Thang Luong, Hieu Pham, Christopher D. Manning* in [Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04025v5.pdf) which is available at [papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/effective-approaches-to-attention-based).

I have summarized this paper in the  blog post available here [link](url).

<hr>

![intro-to-attention](/assets/week2/c4w2-23-intro-to-attention.png#sl)

- Dot product attention is the main operation in transformers. 
- It is more of less a dot product between the embedding of source and target sequences.
- The embedding are trained to make equivalent words close together across languages.

<hr>

![queries-keys-values](/assets/week2/c4w2-24-queries-keys-values.png#sl)

Dot product attention could be summarized as follows:

- we encode the source and target as Query, Key & Value matrices
- we take product $(Q K^T)$ which gives us weights for the relative importance of keys to queries - they can be thought as alignment or content scores.
- we apply the $softmax(Q K^T)$ to normalize these weights into probabilities.
- we apply these to $V$ to get a weighed sum of the input.

### Query, Key & Value

The input and output sequences are mapped to an embedding layer to become the $Q, K$ and $V$ matrices.
each word in the input corresponds to a column these matrices.

the input and output sequences are mapped to an embedding layer become the Q, K and V matrices.

In the master class linked bellow Dr. ≈Åukasz Kaiser talks about attention and here he is talking about solving the problem of retrieving information from a long sequence. This is essentially what alignment was also trying to do. So if we think about retrieving information from a memory:

- The **Query** is the embedding for a token in the *target* sequence we wish to process. 
- The **Key** is our the embedding of the token from the source sequence.

<hr>

![concept-of-attention](/assets/week2/c4w2-25-concept-of-attention.png#sl)

Given an input, you transform it into a new representation or a column vector. Depending on the task you are working on, you will end up getting queries, keys, and values. Each column corresponds to a word in the figure above. Hence, when you compute the following: 
<hr>

![attention-math](/assets/week2/c4w2-26-attention-math.png#sl)

This concept implies that similar vectors are likely to have a higher score when you dot them with one another. You transform that score into a probability by using a softmax function. You can then multiply the output by 

You can think of the **keys** and the **values** as being the same. 

<hr>

![attention-formula](/assets/week2/c4w2-27-attention-formula.png#sl)

Note that both $K,V$ are of dimension $L_k,D$. Each query $q_i$ picks the most similar key $k_j$

Queries are the German words and the keys are the English words. Once you have the attention weights, you can just multiply it by VV to get a weighted combination of the input.

# V4: Causal Attention

- In this course we are interested in three main types of attention. 
- We'll see a brief overview of causal attention. 
- We'll discover some mathematical foundations behind the causal attention. 
<hr>

![three-ways-of-attention](/assets/week2/c4w2-30-three-ways-of-attention.png#sl)

There are three types of attention mechanisms:

1. Encoder-Decoder attention AKA dot product attention:
   - one sentence in the decoder look at to another one in the encoder.
   - e.g. in translation model.
2. Causal Attention:
   - In the same sentence words attend to previous words. 
   - Future words have not been generated yet. 
   - e.g. in text generation of summaries.
3. Bi-directional self attention:
   - In one sentence words look both at previous and future words.
   - !!! TODO: add use case. !!!
<hr>

![causal attention](/assets/week2/c4w2-31-causal-attention.png#sl)

In causal attention, **queries** and **keys** come from the same sentence. That is why it is often referred to as **self-attention**.  In general, causal attention allows words to attend to other words that are related in various ways. 
<hr>

![causal attention mask](/assets/week2/c4w2-32-causal-attention-mask.png#sl)

At a high level
We have K Q V matrices.  corresponding
However, token should not attend to words in the future since these were not generated yet.

Therefore the future token's data is masked by adding a big negative number.

# V5: Multi-head Attention

![outline-of-muti-head-attention](/assets/week2/c4w2-40-outline-of-mutihead-attention.png#sl)

Let's summarize the intuition behind **multi-head attention** and **scaled dot product attention**.

<hr>

![muti-head-attention](/assets/week2/c4w2-41-muti-head-attention.png#sl)

Q. What are multiple attention heads?

- Multiple attention heads are simply replicas of the attention mechanism. In this they are analogous to the multiple filters used in a convolutional neural networks (CNN). 
- During training they specialize by learning different relationships between words.
- During inference the operate parallel and independently of each other.
  
<hr>

![overview of muti-head attention](/assets/week2/c4w2-42-overview-of-muti-head-attention.png#sl)

<hr>

![muti-head attention scaled dot-product](/assets/week2/c4w2-43-muti-head-attention-scaled-dot-product.png#sl)

<hr>

Given a word, you take its embedding then you multiply it by the $Q$, $K$, $V$ matrix to get the corresponding queries, keys and values. When you use multi-head attention, a head can learn different relationships between words from another head. 

Here's one way to look at it: 

-  First, imagine that you have an embedding for a word. You multiply that embedding with $Q$ to get $q_1$, $K$ to get $k_1$, and V to get $v_1$
<hr>

![muti-head-attention-math](/assets/week2/c4w2-53-muti-head-attention-math.png#sl)

<hr>
- Next, you feed it to the linear layer, once you go through the linear layer for each word, you need to calculate a score. After that, you end up having an embedding for each word. But you still need to get the score for how much of each word you are going to use. For example, this will tell you how similar two words are $q_1$ and $k_1$or even $q_1$ and $k_2$  by doing a simple $q_1 \dot k_1$. You can take the softmax of those scores (the paper mentions that you have to divide by $\sqrt(d)$ to get a probability and then you multiply that by the value. That gives you the new representation of the word.

If you have many heads, you can concatenate them and then multiply again by a matrix that is of dimension (dim of each head by num heads - dim of each head) to get one final vector corresponding to each word. 

Here is step by step guide, first you get the $Q$, $K$, $V$ matrices: 

Note that the computation above was done for one head. If you have several heads, concretely nn, then you will have $Z_1, Z_2, ..., Z_n$. In which case, you can just concatenate them and multiply by a $W_O$ matrix as follows:

Hence, the more heads you have, the more $Z$s you will end up concatenating and as a result, that will change the inner dimension of $W_O$, which will then project the combined embeddings into one final embedding.
