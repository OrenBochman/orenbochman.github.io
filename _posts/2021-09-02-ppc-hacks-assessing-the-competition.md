# Question:

  > Can you recommend a strategy for assessing the digital marketing efforts by our competitors?

It seems that with the exception of SEO departments, keeping tabs on the competition is one of the most neglected activities in the digital marketing arena and I may suggest the following reasons: 

## Why competitive intelligence neglected?

Most clients believe that by maximizing their spend on media will have the greatest impact on desired goals. With this mindset costs of analytics is viewed a necessary evil that should be provided as part by their agency. And while most agencies will gladly conduct advanced analytics, creating attribution models, conduct A/B testing to optimize different aspects of your campaign and web properties,

Informing the client that the age-old adage quoted above applies to their campaigns is viewed as the type of confession that will more likely lose an account rather than get a deeper investment into analytics. But without deep analysis of a client activities any decisions are still going to be HIPPO driven rather than Data driven and these will lead to  large amount of marketing spend going to waste.

A more enlightened view is that at every step our marketing dollar will either get us the desired action or get us the information needed to get there. This data driven approach is the only way to hit the high velocity moving target that is the world of digital marketing.

we either buy  we  we want to either win or  based on gut admission of guilt considered not something an agency is simply not the type of message an agency is going to deliver, certainly not when it can cost them the . And to this day the best analytics and attribution models can be hard pressed to do better.This is what Sun Tzu called knowing yourself.

Keeping tabs on multiple competitors will require collecting lots data, compiling it, reading it and disseminating it in-house. This raises two issues, who will do it and who will pay for it. An agency is typically paid percentages off the top of the marketing spend. The exception is SEO which is generally an easy sell to unsophisticated clients with a small budget and also a very effective method to foster a long tern bushiness relationship since SEO requires a long term intervention to be effective. Reporting the progress in SEO involves keeping track of a clients standing and the positioning of the competition is naturally part of that. Also a competitor's on-page SEO can be inspected and improved on.

So to recap competitive analysis 

includes:
1. what new products they're developing (out of scope)
1. who they are your competitors (hint look at SERP)
1. who they are your competitors' customers (hint - using cohorts of intelligent agents that have social media and email account, surf the web targeting your competition, collecting cookies and pass for humans).
1. what types of audiences they're targeting ()
1. what products or services different customers buy from them. (data mining customer response on e- commerce platforms)
1. what customers see as your competitors' strengths and weaknesses (data mining social media and forums)
1. whether there are any long-standing customers (data mining social media and forums)
1. if they've had an influx of customers recently (increase in chatter in social media, forums and shop)
1. what financial resources they have (looking how often their campaigns run out of budget)


Convicting the clients to a dime for basic analytics is a challenge as this is perceived to be an integral part of the service. 

Getting a client to pay extra for the advanced analytics is a serious challenge as even today many people working in in marketing hate statistics, and prefer this work fall under the purview of their IT or some other department which are naturally siloed. less interested This type of information is  and it is paid for is usually 

I am not sure why this is not a typical marketing question but I believe this is one of the biggest sources of uncertainty affecting your campaigns. Studying your competition is a very broad subject. It is certainly an important activity when launching a new venture and it is also something to keep looking into overtime. 

An information scientist could help you research this periodically and your sales department and many other personnel may give you early signals of serious competitor activity. These early signals should be allowed to be heard, but I want to restrict this discussion to the still rather broad area of the competitors digital marketing activities.

Before we consider what we should ask we may first consider what one hopes to do with this intelligence.

# Goals and Actions

1. Identify the competitors.
1. Do a SWOT analysis to evaluate strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the competition


1. Learn from and do better than your competition.
1. Lean where you are better.
1. Learn where you are about the same.


# Breaking it down:
Anyhow here are some key questions to assess and possibly validate.

1. Who are your competitors
    - known players
    - new players (consider using alerts of different types)
1. What do you need to know about your competitors' digital marketing?
    - their web properties
        - web sites / landing pages / apps
    - their SEO strategy
    - their campaign
        - acquisition
        - media used
        - social media activity
    - the technology, they use can offer insights into thier budget.



# Predictive Models

If one collect sufficient data it may become possible to predict to what your competition will impact the success of our campaign. One can estimate their budget, their desired positioning, the percent of daily eyeballs they are getting, their sales and so on. One should try and figure out  if and when their daily budget runs out in different campaigns and it may be possible to estimate how much they are driving up the cost of conversions by bidding against us in the realtime auctions. Of course these should all come with uncertainty intervals - as we are not privy to the real data.

However, predictive models are not well suited to identifying what action should be taken. In many cases they can tell point you in the right direction but if you want to consider multiple what-if scenario's you need a different class of models and these are called prescriptive models.

# Prescriptive Models

Prescriptive model are built around the same ideas as predictive models. They can contain a  recommendation model and they can be set up to consider whole distributions of factors and can be controlled with a UI to select or filter out different conditions. Finally they can contain a game theoretic component that considers iterated application of strategy profiles for different actors.
